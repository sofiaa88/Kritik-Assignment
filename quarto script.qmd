# Quarto In-Class Assignment

#### First, each of you has an assigned dataset from the R datasets package. Produce a one-page Quarto document that contains your visualization of your assigned dataset. The document should have a short explanatory paragraph introducing the data and be suitable for an on-screen presentation in the Practicum.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
data(UCBAdmissions)
df <- data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x= Dept, y= Freq, color= Gender))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Visualization")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
### The data could be telling us the spring and fall application volume. The two colors represent Gender. 

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
